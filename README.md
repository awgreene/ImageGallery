# Welcome
In this tutorial I followed the directions outlined by [Colt Steele]( https://www.linkedin.com/in/coltsteele/) in section 6 (Intermediate CSS) of the [The Web Developer Bootcamp]( https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/learn/v4/overview )class.

# Why I Completed the Tutorial
With a history of backend development roles, I came to realize that to become a better engineer I needed to learn more about frontend development. To most individuals, the frontend is the product, and I was always nervous about sharing examples of my work publicly because of my limited frontend development skills. After hearing about [Brandon Morelli](https://github.com/bmorelli25/Become-A-Full-Stack-Web-Developer)'s experience, I decided that it was about time I learn more about frontend development.

# Overall Impression of this Tutorial
So far I’ve found this course to be an incredible compliment to the work I completed in Shay Howe’s [Learn to Code HTML & CSS](http://learn.shayhowe.com/) course. I find that this course has helped reinforced key takeaways that will improve my ability to create engaging websites. I feel far more equipped with the principles outlined in both courses now and am more confident than ever in my frontend abilities.
